## Calculus Calculator Program

Goal : Simple react app that will solve calculus problems and list the steps

### 'What's Done'
    1)Recursively builds a tree structure out of it 
    2)Uses DFS based algorithm to solve problem using node values
    3)Displays solution to problem to user

### `TODO`
    1)Implement math functions for calc problems
    2)Improve user UI
    3)Work on display of math steps, perhaps even displaying the tree structure
